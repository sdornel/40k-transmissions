# cli-multi-tool
(formerly 40k-transmissions)

A goofy 40k app I made to brush up on Ruby. If I get far enough it will also be usable for a variety of different tasks.

Current functionality:
- Displays randomized 40k quotes
- GitHub scripts. Logic relies on octokit
- Weather data

TODO:
- Finance
    - stock market
    - crypto
    - value of currencies
